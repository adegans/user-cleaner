## Description
If you have a lot of people (or bots) registering on your site that end up doing nothing with their account they may as well be deleted. \
**AJdG User Cleaner** works on a daily schedule to check and delete unused accounts that registered 2 weeks before. This means that the new registrant has 2 weeks to do something with their account. Doing something means; post a comment, create a page or create a blogpost.

Additionally **AJdG User Cleaner** supports WooCommerce and bbPress. \
If the user creates an order in WooCommerce or a topic or reply in bbPress the account is not deleted.
If either WooCommerce or bbPress is not active those will not count towards deleting the users.

This works very simple, **AJdG User Cleaner** checks applicable accounts for the required activities. \
The simplicity of the plugin also means that no warning or notification is given when deleting accounts. \
Accounts are not placed in a trash bin. Deleting of accounts is permanent.

This plugin has no settings and works quietly in the background.
